## Tableau Introduction + Working with GCP and Tableau 

These are hands-on activities for working with financial and other data sets in Tableau. Tableau is a data visualisation ecosystem of multiple products: 

+ Tableau Public is available for free to use with non-confidential data to create vizzes and publish them. 

+ Tableau Desktop is the licensed version of the same software with more flexible end user functionality and is used for secure data.
  
+ Tableau desktop allows for the possible connection to GCP data sources including big query, if authentication and network has been configured


### Process

The end to end process you will follow in either case of using local files or GCP sources is: 
1. Connect to the data sources (local files or cloud) 
2. Customise the data source layer – relate tables, apply filters, create new
calculated columns, or extract information from existing fields
3. Configure tableau worksheets, or vizzes (one visual or table per worksheet) with filters 
4. Combine vizzes in dashboards
5. Add additional interactivity (dashboard actions)
6. Optionally, combine dashboards and worksheets into stories
7. Publish worksheets and dashboards, or stories


### Getting started 

First you will need to register the product as a trial or with the credentials provided by Lucy. Logging into Tableau requries MFA setup. 
If you experience any problems with logging in to your Tableau desktop you should contact Lucy at *lbgprogrammes@qa.com* and proceed to use the trial version

### Objective 

You will get comfortable creating Tableau workbooks in Tableau Desktop on your LOD, connecting to raw data sources and you will learn the basics of the data source layer, before seeing how to use the visual front end in Tableau to design charts and compile simple interactive dashboards.
Effective storytelling requires narrative, accompanying the visualisations, so we will also explore the ways Tableau allows us to add our own insights and narrative to the charts and dashboards, tuned to our audience.

## Demonstration A

instructor will use a [demonstration workbook](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sianedavies/viz/demo_NWind/Freight-productsdatesanddestinations) to demonstrate the following main features: 
+ connecting to data source file
+ data source view options
+ UI navigation
+ show me menu
+ create a visual using Rows and columns
+ fit window controls
+ sorting
+ Marks card – colour, type, label, tooltip
+ Filtering
+ Aggregation
+ Dealing with nulls
+ analytics pane - trend lines
